This is Ivan, one of the instructors at AiCore

First of all, just wanted to welcome you to the team! Tonight, you will have your first session, for which Harry will be responsible to run the orientation. After that, we will explain the scope of your first project.
Just to let you know, we run these session in different breakout rooms in a zoom call. Harry will explain more on that tonight. However, for the orientation, you will go to room 2 with the rest of new users to attend to orientation.
